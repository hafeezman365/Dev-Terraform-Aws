Terraform is an open-source infrastructure as code (IaC) tool created by HashiCorp that enables users to define and provision infrastructure using code. Terraform uses a declarative syntax to define the desired state of infrastructure, and then creates and manages resources to achieve that state.

In the code above, we define the required provider for AWS, which includes the source and version of the provider. We also specify the region and access credentials for our AWS provider.

Next, we define the AWS VPC resource, which includes the CIDR block for the VPC and tags for identification. We then define the AWS subnet resource, which includes the VPC ID, CIDR block, and availability zone. We also enable public IP mapping for the subnet.

We then define the AWS internet gateway resource, which includes the VPC ID and tags for identification. We also define the AWS route table resource and the default route, which routes all traffic through the internet gateway.

We then define the AWS route table association, which associates the route table with the subnet.

Next, we define the AWS security group resource, which includes the VPC ID, inbound rules to allow TLS traffic from the VPC, and outbound rules to allow all traffic.

We then define the AWS EC2 instance resource, which includes the instance type, AMI ID, key pair, security group, subnet ID, and root block device. We also specify tags for identification.

Finally, we generate an SSH key pair and specify the public key in the key pair resource.
